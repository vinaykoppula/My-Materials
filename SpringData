Spring Data
==================
=>persistent store
                           Best Practises for DAO logic development

=>Persistent logic/data logic/dao logic
=>Jdbc,orm,spring data
=>plain jdbc develope dao logic
=>spring jdbc,orm,data(spring)
=>spring data in micro services
=>spring orm and data(recomended)
=>number of queries is number of network calls
=>write sql query to delete dup rows from table
100 mouse 300.00
101 keyboard 400.00
100 mouse 300.00---duplicate rows,

group by pratition data
=>ram m
ajay m
vijay f
vinay f

decode('m','f','f','f')
=>pk mandatory orm framworks
=>Data fix,modify data on production mode on realtime db,when data corupted
=>Auditing
=>Rollbacking
=>Hard fix,jsp file corputed ,then dont deploy the complete project takes more time 4 hrs,deploy jsp 

=>best practises for persistent layer development:
1)maintain separate component dao/repo
2)for every table for every dao class(1000 tables 1000 daos),maitainability will inceraed,
3)every table should contain one pk
4)pk mandatory orm framworks
5)use custome generators ,we have 11 predefined generators
6)indexes,more search opeartion son single coulmn
7)every table contain 4 colulmns for historcal RD,
WEEK_STARTDATE
WEEK_LASTDATE
Who updated
when updated
8)soft delete,make it inactive 
9)embeded db,for unti testing of dao
10)lengthy names CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DETAILS,CSTMR_CRDT_CRD_DTLS
11)some tables are tarcnastional atbles(modifying) and non transactional tables(non modifying)
static data get in map object,for 10000 ok but if 1 million rows,then use cache concept(),reduce db interaction for performance,map 
availbe in jvm ,if it is db network will make
1st level cahce 
2 level cahe
query cache
redis cache
distrinuted app,distsributed cahceh machanism
LRU cahe(realtime used) least used cache,1 million records,which record is not used frequently that will be removed 
compromise on technologies for performance jdbc,
dont make db call get it from jvm cahche for non transaction atble,

12)use connection pool to avoid physical connection ,use logical connection
connectionexashtedprobelm/exception when db dont have connection to give u
physical connection Connection con=DM.getConnection();,it is open with u until unless u closed it manuallay
while(rs.next()){


}
after 10 record printing then pick the remaining 10 from db like pagination
get the connection form pool that is logical connection ,pool manager will manage
=>hikary connection ,in built ds for boot will maintain the connections
=>ResultSet will load data 10 rows only OracelDriver we can set limit ,ResultSet fecth size
=>when from jdbc selct operation get only 10 records for other 10 records will make another db call,db will get all records
hibernate c3p0 built in connection pool ,boot hikari
13)use projections(select perticluar query) in select query
never use *,db will perform lookup which will degare the performance
14)dynamic insert and dynamic update...

milli sec alos imp,13 micro services calls,every micro services will make db call ,make asycnchronus call ,last year 1600 ms,but we 

use plain jdbc we make it 900 ms,ORM will degrade the performance ,hibernate -HQL-sql,we make it 300 ms using redis cahe
performacne is imp or technologies is imp,for banking perfomracen is imp...

                                SPRING DATA REPOSITORY

=>USER_MASTER Table UserMasterEntity naming 
=>Entity for Dao ,Model for Data like also there
=>UserMasterDao(I){
}
UserMasterEntity(C)
TRIGGER_MASTER
USER_MASTER(T)
UserMasterDaoImpl
=>save()
Update()
findbyId()
findAll()
delete()
deleteAll()---common operations

common methods for every dao impl classes, so boiler plate code can be maintained in one classs or spring data will wirte the
logic for these methods ,so we no need to maintain the logic also
=>UserMaster,RoleMaster,UserRoles ...
=>UserMaster{
int userId;
String fname;
String lname;

}

USER_MASTER

USER_ID INTEGER,
FIRST_NAME VARCHAR2(25),
LAST_NAME VARCHAR2(25)

=>SRING ORM we write the logic also for db operations
=>use find method stating not get
=>spring data we use only interface no impl
=>Spring data abstarction layer on top of orm
=>Realization(realtionship) interface dao
=>i want ot talk to the tables with objects
=>RDMS stroe the data in text format,java represent data in object format,then there is mismatch between java and rdms
=>impedence mismatch,jdbc deals with text data,orm object,jdbc deont support object format so we go for hibernate
=>orm covering mismatch between rdms and oops languages...
=>only hibernate is doing convertion
=>Object relational mapping
=>

@Entity
@Data
@Table(name="USER_MASTER")
public class UserMasterEntity{

@Id
@Column(name="USER_ID")
public int userId;
@Column(name="FIRST_NAME")
private String fname;
@Column(name="LAST_NAME")
private String lname;

}

=>Association mapping spring orm,spring data only one table(CRUD operations) for joins go for orm
=>we can use spring orm and spring data together also...
=>jdbc get data in resultset after that we have to convert into object manually,orm will do this for us,orm will use hql convertions
=>Spring data we use repository convention not dao
=>Spring repository

CrudRepository  responsible for only crud ioperations
JpaRepository  can do surd and sorting pagination also
=>simple we have to extend our dao with these repositories

UserMasterDao extends CrudRepository{

}
=>we need only inteface no impl
=>public interface CrudRepository<T, ID extends Serializable>
